Project 5 report
Here I will discuss how the user would use the report created in Power BI

A Power BI report is one or more pages of visualizations, graphics, and text. All of the visualizations in a report come from a single dataset.
These visualizations improve decision making and present the end user with more specific and important data relevant to the bussines.

I have added a measure that calculates the highest number of the ID column in the Sub-Category table to easily see how much ID's 
there are to determine how many the table contains, these rows are not duplicates as all duplicates have been removed.
Furthermore a calculated column has been added using a DAX function, this function called "Number of devices active" calculates the total number of devices that are active in the Device Table. This allows the user to view all the current active devices.

Filters across pages and visuals have been added to sort data and information based on some selected criteria such as filters based on device category,  device platform, 
device zone and device registration date.
